Microcode revisions 0x2000065 and higher for Intel Skylake-X/W (family 6,
model 85, stepping 4; CPUID 0x50654) were disabled as they could cause system
hangs on reboot, so the previous revision 0x2000064 was used instead.
Please refer to /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/caveats/06-55-04_readme
and /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/README.caveats for details.
