Some Intel Tiger Lake-UP3/UP4 CPU models (TGL, family 6, model 140, stepping 1)
had reports of system hangs when a microcode update, that was included
since microcode-20201110 update, was applied[1].  In order to address this,
microcode update had been disabled by default on these systems.  The revision
0x88 seems to have fixed the aforementioned issue, hence it is enabled
by default (but can be disabled explicitly; see below).

The information regarding disabling microcode update is provided below.

To disable 06-8c-01 microcode updates for a specific kernel
version, please create a file "disallow-intel-06-8c-01" inside
/lib/firmware/<kernel_version> directory, run
"/usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/update_ucode" to remove it from the firmware
directory where microcode is available for late microcode update, and run
"dracut -f --kver <kernel_version>", so initramfs for this kernel version
is regenerated, for example:

    touch /lib/firmware/3.10.0-862.9.1/disallow-intel-06-8c-01
    /usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/update_ucode
    dracut -f --kver 3.10.0-862.9.1

To avoid addition of this microcode for all kernels, please create file
"/etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/disallow-intel-06-8c-01", run
"/usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/update_ucode" for late microcode updates,
and "dracut -f --regenerate-all" for early microcode updates:

    mkdir -p /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats
    touch /etc/microcode_ctl/ucode_with_caveats/disallow-intel-06-8c-01
    /usr/libexec/microcode_ctl/update_ucode
    dracut -f --regenerate-all

Please refer to /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/README.caveats for additional
information.
