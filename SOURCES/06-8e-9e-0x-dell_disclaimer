Some Dell systems that use some models of Intel CPUs are susceptible to hangs
and system instability during or after microcode update to newer revisions.
In order to address this, microcode update to these newer revision
has been disabled by default on these systems, and the previously published
microcode revisions are used by default for the OS-driven microcode update.
Please refer to /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/caveats/06-8e-9e-0x-dell_readme
and /usr/share/doc/microcode_ctl/README.caveats for details.
